# Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 for NInfer

This model card is the version-controlled source for
[neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer).

The repository contains a mixed NVFP4/FP8 representation of
[Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B). It combines the official BF16 checkpoint
with the fixed packed Text weights from
[unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4) in the native
[NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) `.ninfer` artifact format. The artifact is intended
only for NInfer; it is not a Transformers checkpoint, Safetensors distribution, or GGUF file.

The artifact uses the Qwen3.5 Dense architecture. Text layers 0–55 use NVFP4 MLP weights,
while the token embedding, attention input/output
projections, GDN Q/K/V/Z and output projections, full output head, and Text layers 56–63 MLP weights
use row-scaled FP8. Control weights use BF16, with separate MTP, Vision and DFlash2 weights.

## Artifact

| Filename | `qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` |
| Size | 23,719,715,844 bytes (22.09 GiB) |
| SHA-256 | `74d2c57145e6ff11d1d2faa79594477f9bc903a611af1fb20218189fbbb77d82` |
| Container version | 3 |
| Architecture | `Qwen3_5ForCausalLM` |
| Public model name | `qwen3.8-27b` |
| Chat template | [qwen3_8.jinja](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/98dada0e03cb073fd07f905400b5904bc6e82759/tools/chat_templates/qwen3_8.jinja); override with `--chat-template FILE` |
| Template defaults | thinking on; effort `xhigh`; closed-turn reasoning retained |
| Stored objects | 1,246 (1,240 tensors and 6 resources) |
| NVFP4 tensors | 112 |
| Row-scaled FP8 tensors | 146 |

The file contains Text, Vision, MTP, DFlash2, the optimized proposal head and frontend resources.
Vision and speculative weights are loaded only when selected at startup. Source-derived NVFP4 and
FP8 words are preserved without decode and requantization; only the official BF16 token embedding
is encoded locally as row-scaled FP8.

Verify a downloaded file with:

```bash
printf '%s  %s\n' \
  '74d2c57145e6ff11d1d2faa79594477f9bc903a611af1fb20218189fbbb77d82' \
  'qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer' | sha256sum --check
```

This release includes the complete DFlash2 companion weights from
`z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2` at revision
`50307d4c4cde6860d4eee73e2547cd786fe8e8a4`. Select
`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft`; draft counts 1..15 are supported.
DFlash2 requires the runtime revision listed below. Existing performance and evaluation tables
retain their stated MTP configurations and revisions.

## Requirements

- [NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) revision
  [`04350ba9`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/98dada0e03cb073fd07f905400b5904bc6e82759)
  or later, built from source;
- 64-bit Linux;
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (`sm_120a`);
- CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or newer.

Already have the official v2 file? [Upgrade it locally](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/weight-conversion.md#upgrade-an-existing-v2-artifact)
without downloading the weights again.

NInfer does not provide an install target or packaged binary. See the
[repository README](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer#quick-start) for source-build dependencies.

## Download and run a CLI example

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer \
  qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --local-dir models

./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode in three sentences." \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --max-new 8192 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For images, videos, and structured chat history, see the
[CLI guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/cli.md).

## Start a local server

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. The shared 240,000-token Device KV pool admits
two active requests when their combined completion reservations fit; either request may use the
full pool while running alone. Two extra Device checkpoint slots, eight pinned Host State slots,
and 8 GiB of pinned Host KV retain reusable continuations under resource pressure.

See the [HTTP serving guide](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/serving.md) for the
API surface and the [resource scheduling reference](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md)
for cache and admission semantics.

## Supported use

The artifact supports:

- text generation in thinking and non-thinking modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- DFlash2 with draft windows from one to fifteen using the included
  DFlash2 companion weights (`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7`, optionally `--lm-head-draft`);
- BF16, INT8, FP8, NVFP4, and K8V4 KV cache;
- CUDA Graph decode and compatible-prefix reuse;
- startup-bounded small-scale concurrent serving with true batched decode;
- the NInfer CLI;
- OpenAI Responses Core, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages serving.

## Performance

Measured on September 28–29, 2026 with NInfer revision
[`7f6aafed`](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/commit/7f6aafedb5f20200def820cfe51ab81c09c20eeb),
one RTX 5090, driver 617.14, and CUDA 13.4 compile/runtime/driver API.
These serving runs use FP8 E4M3 row-256 KV, CUDA Graphs, a 1,024-token prefill chunk, disabled
prefix reuse, and temperature 0.6 / top-p 0.95 / top-k 20 / min-p 0 / presence penalty 1.0 /
frequency penalty 0. MTP0 has a 262,144-token context ceiling; MTP3 uses 131,072 tokens per
request, three draft tokens, the optimized proposal head, and automatic shared KV capacity.

### Concurrent MTP=3 corpus makespan

Each C is one complete 75-request corpus, with three reasoning and twelve cross-scenario fixtures,
five seeds per fixture, and a fixed shuffled send order. Makespan includes prefill, decode,
admission waits, transitions, and drain; actual output lengths vary.

| C | Requests | Computed prefill tokens | Decode tokens | Makespan (s) | Requests/s | Corpus prefill (tok/s) | Corpus decode (tok/s) | Avg batch | MTP acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 75 | 15,460 | 693,701 | 4,115.22 | 0.0182 | 3.8 | 168.6 | 1.00 | 59.6% |
| 2 | 75 | 15,460 | 709,989 | 2,394.23 | 0.0313 | 6.5 | 296.5 | 1.90 | 58.9% |
| 4 | 75 | 15,460 | 722,202 | 1,640.17 | 0.0457 | 9.4 | 440.3 | 3.13 | 58.5% |
| 8 | 75 | 15,460 | 708,589 | 1,443.37 | 0.0520 | 10.7 | 490.9 | 3.52 | 59.5% |

All 300 requests completed without request, CUDA, or allocation errors. At C=1/2/4/8,
automatic KV capacity is 131,072 / 262,144 / 253,632 / 225,024 tokens. C=8 has average batch 3.52
and up to five waiting requests in the sampled intervals. The resident MTP3 weights occupy
19.729 GiB, and the workspace arena is 243.3 MiB.

### Long-context serving (MTP disabled)

Values are arithmetic mean ± sample standard deviation over five fixed seeds per fixture.

| Prompt tokens | Samples | Prefill phase (tok/s) | Server TTFT (ms) | Decode phase (tok/s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7,680 | 5 | 12,819.1 ± 16.8 | 602.7 ± 1.1 | 74.1 ± 0.3 |
| 64,512 | 5 | 8,658.2 ± 44.8 | 7,487.4 ± 37.7 | 68.2 ± 0.2 |
| 130,048 | 5 | 6,198.5 ± 19.6 | 21,055.7 ± 67.2 | 62.5 ± 0.3 |
| 260,096 | 5 | 4,016.4 ± 10.4 | 64,910.0 ± 171.8 | 53.4 ± 0.6 |

### MTP=3 single-request long-reasoning decode

The C=1 corpus supplies these phase statistics, with five samples per reasoning fixture.

| Fixture | Samples | Completion tokens | Decode phase (tok/s) | MTP3 acceptance | MTP3 tokens/round |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `long_decode_aime26_01` | 5 | 1,559.4 ± 727.2 | 207.4 ± 3.6 | 77.2% ± 1.8% | 3.32 ± 0.05 |
| `long_decode_aime26_15` | 5 | 65,536.0 ± 0.0 | 161.7 ± 3.8 | 57.2% ± 2.1% | 2.72 ± 0.06 |
| `long_decode_aime26_30` | 5 | 37,978.0 ± 7,474.4 | 170.0 ± 2.3 | 59.9% ± 1.5% | 2.80 ± 0.05 |

### MTP=3 single-request cross-scenario decode

Each category pools three fixtures × five seeds. Values are mean ± sample standard deviation.

| Category | Samples | Decode phase (tok/s) | MTP3 acceptance | MTP3 tokens/round |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Code | 15 | 205.3 ± 9.5 | 76.8% ± 5.1% | 3.30 ± 0.15 |
| Story | 15 | 132.6 ± 13.1 | 37.6% ± 7.1% | 2.13 ± 0.21 |
| Translation | 15 | 202.9 ± 12.3 | 75.2% ± 6.6% | 3.26 ± 0.20 |
| Structured | 15 | 231.7 ± 10.6 | 90.6% ± 5.6% | 3.72 ± 0.17 |

All five AIME 15 samples reach the 65,536-token output budget. The C=1 corpus contains
40 stop-token and 35 output-limit results; all are retained in the statistics. These measurements
do not score answer accuracy or task completion.

The [full results and reproduction commands](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer/blob/master/docs/performance/qwen3.8-27b.md)
also cover DFlash2 K=7, MTP3 decode saturation, and completion outcomes.

## Evaluation

The artifact was evaluated through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking enabled,
MTP=3, and INT8 group-64 KV. EvalScope 1.9.0 used 0-shot prompts, rule-based scoring, and one sample
per problem with temperature 1.0, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, presence penalty 0.0, and seed 42. The text
suite ran at a 252,928-token context limit; the multimodal suite ran with `--vision` at a
81,920-token limit.

| Benchmark | NInfer NVFP4 | Correct / total | Official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| IFBench (prompt-level strict) | 77.00% | 231 / 300 | 79.5 |
| AIME 2025 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| AIME 2026 | 96.67% | 29 / 30 | — |
| GPQA-Diamond | 90.40% | 179 / 198 | 89.2 |
| ERQA | 66.25% | 265 / 400 | 65.5 |
| RealWorldQA | 83.53% | 639 / 765 | 85.9 |

All 1,723 configured samples completed and were scored. IFBench additionally reports 80.50%
instruction-level strict, 80.33% prompt-level loose, and 83.50% instruction-level loose. These are
single-sample results, not pass@k.

The official Qwen3.8-27B BF16 figures come from the
[upstream model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B); its sampling settings and IFBench
metric level are not stated there, so the last column is not a same-protocol comparison. The NVFP4
deltas stay within ±2.5 points on the four overlapping benchmarks, and the upstream card reports no
AIME results.

## Limits

- NInfer executes on one RTX 5090 and one CUDA device, with a startup-fixed capacity of 1–8 active
  requests per Engine.
- It does not provide large-scale or preemptive continuous batching, priority/QoS scheduling,
  multi-GPU execution, CPU/GPU offload, or distributed serving.
- Context allocation is subject to GPU memory and the selected KV-cache type.
- NInfer does not execute generated tool calls.
