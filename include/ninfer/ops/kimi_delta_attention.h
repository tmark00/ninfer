/**
 * Kimi Delta Attention, independently for every value head h. Its shared query/key head is
 * qh=floor(h/(Hv/Hqk)). Normalize each represented q/k row with epsilon 1e-6, then define
 *
 *   a_h          = exp(A_log[h])
 *   log_alpha[c] = lower_bound * sigmoid(a_h * (g[c,h,t] + dt_bias[c,h]))
 *   alpha[c]     = exp(log_alpha[c])
 *   b            = sigmoid(beta[h,t]).
 *
 * Starting from logical FP32 state S_h[value,key], for t in increasing order:
 *
 *   decayed      = S_h * diag(alpha)
 *   delta        = b * (v[:,h,t] - decayed * k[:,qh,t])
 *   S_h          = decayed + outer(delta, k[:,qh,t])
 *   ideal[:,h,t] = scale * S_h * q[:,qh,t].
 *
 * Contiguous represented inputs are q/k BF16 [128,Hqk,T], v/g/out BF16 [128,Hv,T],
 * beta BF16 [Hv,T], A_log FP32 [Hv], dt_bias FP32 [128,Hv], state FP32 [128,128,Hv].
 * Physical state index is ((h*128+value)*128+key). Hqk>=1, Hv>=Hqk, Hv%Hqk==0, T>=1.
 * lower_bound is finite in [-5,0]; scale is 1/sqrt(128). Inputs/out are non-overlapping.
 * State input/output may be disjoint or exactly alias; no other operand overlaps state.
 *
 * The independent oracle evaluates the complete recurrence naively in FP64 from the represented
 * BF16 inputs and FP32 parameters/state, with no private staging or output rounding. Recurrent
 * FP32 SIMT and chunked BF16/TF32 MMA are private arithmetic profiles qualified directly against
 * that oracle. Running and published state stay FP32; the output epilogue rounds once to BF16.
 * Q/K normalization, activated gates, triangular solves, residuals and accumulators stay FP32;
 * chunked decay-weighted Q/K operands have private BF16 storage. Chunked state prediction and
 * small matrix products use TF32 MMA; Q readout and state updates use BF16 MMA with FP32
 * accumulators. State snapshots and Delta stay FP32, converting only their BF16 MMA operands.
 * Transcendental approximations and reduction association are implementation details.
 *
 * workspace supplies the capacity query above and is scoped to the call; the Op allocates no
 * device storage. execution supplies the stream and physical SM count for launch decomposition.
 * Chunked execution supports partial final chunks. This overload publishes state after all T
 * tokens into the same state storage.
